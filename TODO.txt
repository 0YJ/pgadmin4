TODO Items
==========

NOTE: If you intend to work on any of these items, please let the development
team know by emailing pgadmin-hackers@postgresql.org.=

Foreign Table Module
--------------------

New functionality added in PG 9.5 for this module as below:

- ALTER [ COLUMN ] col_name SET STORAGE { PLAIN | EXTERNAL | EXTENDED | MAIN }
- DISABLE TRIGGER [ trigger_name | ALL | USER ]
- ENABLE TRIGGER [ trigger_name | ALL | USER ]
- ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER trigger_name
- ENABLE ALWAYS TRIGGER trigger_name
- SET WITH OIDS
- SET WITHOUT OIDS

To add this functionality we need to add Columns, Triggers and Constraints as 
separate Nodes under the Foreign Table Node.

Query Tool updateable recordset support
---------------------------------------

Add smarts to the Query Tool to allow it to recognise if a query produces a
data set that would be updateable (e.g. from a single table, all primary key
columns present), and if so, allow editing.
