TODO Items
==========

NOTE: If you intend to work on any of these items, please let the development
team know by emailing pgadmin-hackers@postgresql.org.=

Foreign Table Module
--------------------

New functionality added in PG 9.5 for this module as below:

- ALTER [ COLUMN ] col_name SET STORAGE { PLAIN | EXTERNAL | EXTENDED | MAIN }
- DISABLE TRIGGER [ trigger_name | ALL | USER ]
- ENABLE TRIGGER [ trigger_name | ALL | USER ]
- ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER trigger_name
- ENABLE ALWAYS TRIGGER trigger_name
- SET WITH OIDS
- SET WITHOUT OIDS

To add this functionality we need to add Columns, Triggers and Constraints as 
separate Nodes under the Foreign Table Node.

Query Tool updateable recordset support
---------------------------------------

Add smarts to the Query Tool to allow it to recognise if a query produces a
data set that would be updateable (e.g. from a single table, all primary key
columns present), and if so, allow editing.

Backup Object
-------------

Allow to select/deselect objects under the object backup operation.

Restore Object
-------------

List down the objects within the backup file, and allow the user to
select/deselect the only objects, which user may want to restore.

Graphical Explain
-----------------
* A better zooming/scaling functionality. A minimap for the explain will be
  very nice.
* Explanation on the statistic for the graphical explain plan.
* Arrow colouring based on the percentage of the cost, and time taken on each
  explain node.
