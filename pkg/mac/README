Building pgAdmin4.dmg on macOS
==============================

Required Packages (Either build the sources or get them from macports or
similar):

1. Yarn & NodeJS

2. PostgreSQL installation
  - PostgreSQL 12 or above from http://www.postgresql.org/

Building:

1. To bundle a different version of Python from the default of 3.9.0, set the
   PGADMIN_PYTHON_VERSION environment variable, e.g:

   export PGADMIN_PYTHON_VERSION=3.8.5

2. If a path different from the default of /usr/local/pgsql for the PostgreSQL
   installation has been used, set the PGADMIN_POSTGRES_DIR environment variable
   appropriately, e.g:

   export PGADMIN_POSTGRES_DIR=/opt/local/pgsql

3. If you want to codesign the appbundle, copy codesign.conf.in to
   codesign.conf and set the values accordingly.

4. To build, go to pgAdmin4 source root directory and execute "make appbundle".
   This will create the python virtual environment and install all the required
   python modules mentioned in the requirements file using pip, build the
   runtime code and finally create the app bundle and the DMG in ./dist
   directory.
