When you install pgAdmin in server mode, you will be prompted to provide a role name and pgAdmin password.  The first role registered with pgAdmin will be an administrative user.  When you authenticate with pgAdmin, pgAdmin displays the server definitions associated with that login role in the tree control. 

An administrative role can use the pgAdmin User Management dialog to create and manage additional pgAdmin user accounts.
