Client Features
***************

pgAdmin 4 has a highly-customizable display that features drag-and-drop panels that you can arrange to make the best use of your desktop environment.  The client features a tree control that provides an elegant overview of the managed servers, and the objects that reside on each server.  Tabbed dialogs provide quick access to statistical information about each object in the tree control.

Use the *Preferences* dialog to customize the content and colors of the pgAdmin display.  To open the *Preferences* dialog, select *Preferences* from the *File* menu.

*Help* buttons in the lower-left corner of each dialog will open the online help for the dialog.  You can access additional Postgres help by navigating through the *Help* menu, and selecting the name of the resource that you wish to open.
